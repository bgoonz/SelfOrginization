<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">You bought a house, it’s ok to freak out</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">So you’ve already talked to a fantastic Mortgage Lender (Why thank you!) You searched high and low with an amazing Realtor who has just negotiated a great deal for your new home. Now the clock is ticking on your closing date and everything is scheduled to run smoothly so you head home to a nice dinner with your spouse. A steak dinner, a good bottle of wine while you make kissy faces at each other and you are off to bed to dream about all the things you want to do with your future home. Sometime during the night you jerk awake in a cold sweat, panting. What the heck have you just done? Can you really afford this house? Is it the wrong color? Will the coffee maker fit on the kitchen counter? Panic has officially set in. Calm down, it’s going to be okay. </span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">It’s very normal to have second thoughts and sometimes it leads to down-right hysteria. You are purchasing a home. You are spending more money than you ever have before. Your family will live every day in the house you have chosen. All of this can be a lot of pressure and you are bound to start thinking about how this could end badly. What concerns you is that your Lender and Realtor simply smile and tell you everything will be ok. It’s like they don’t understand how important this is to you. What the hell is the matter with them? Well I am here to tell you that Yes, we do understand. Yes, it is ok to freak out. I am here to explain why we are telling you it’s ok.</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">  
</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">Before you were ready to start looking for a house you probably talked to a Mortgage Lender. If you are super lucky, you talked to me! I discuss with my clients not only how much money will be needed but how much of a payment they will be comfortable with. It isn’t necessarily about how much you can afford. It’s about how much you can afford while maintaining your lifestyle. Are your kids in private school? Do you love to travel? Do you love eating at Austin’s incredible food trucks six days a week? Your lifestyle is not calculated when deciding how much you qualify for when buying a house. These are vastly important things to think about. I make sure every client understands that what they may qualify for might be more than what they are comfortable with. When we nail down a payment that works, I help you figure out how much house you truly need. This way you get to keep your current lifestyle solidly in place. </span>

<span class="EilAw" dir="auto">Now THIS is the life!</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">  
</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">Other than yours truly, you have a whole team of trained individuals to ensure that the home you are buying, is in fact, the right home. Your Realtor has gotten to know you. They have had many conversations with you about what kind of house you want. How many stories, how big a lot, how quiet and how busy you want the neighborhood. Your Realtor would not steer you to a home that you would not be happy in. You have an Appraiser that will ensure the home you are buying is actually worth what you are spending. A Title Company to make sure you will not have any hidden liens pop up. You will have a Home Inspection person come through the house and look at everything in your future home to ensure you are not walking into a shiny house that is on the verge of collapse. </span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">  
</span>

<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">We all know that buying a home is very emotional and nerve wracking. In the average person’s life, buying a home is one of the most stressful processes to undergo. Freaking out is very normal. Trust that the team you have chosen to work with has got your back. So, go back to sleep and start dreaming about that Honey-Do list that keeps growing and growing. </span>
