"Out of all the people involved in our purchase of our new home, I think Vickie was the easily the most knowledgeable person that we dealt with. She pulled out all the stops to help us get into our new home and I would gladly recommend her to anyone looking for a lender and she is actually worth 10 stars, not just 5."

"Vickie is very knowledgeable with what she does. My loan got rejected at US bank for various reasons and she at AFN made it look so simple. She tells you upfront if you are going to get approved or not. So no wasting TIME. I would highly recommend Vickie for anybody's home mortgage needs."

"Vickie was one of the nicest people I've ever met.  When I was ready to give up on this whole stressful process of even owning my own home, she encouraged me so much. I know that this is her job to make money, but she went above and beyond in giving me a peace of mind. There are still some really good people in this world and I thank God for letting me go through this journey with Vickie as my Broker."

"Vickie really works hard for her clients and is available 7 days a week. Because of my busy schedule during the week, Vickie worked with me on the weekends to answer my questions and always got my loans approved. Even though she is very busy, Vickie will always find the time to assist you. She is very knowledgeable, honest and will find the way to get you the best loan possible. Working with Vickie is a blessing and I can promise you she will not disappoint you."
