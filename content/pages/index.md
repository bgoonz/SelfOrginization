        subtitle: Customer Service? Prove it…
        content: >
          > We hear the term Customer Service every day.  It pops up when
          watching T.V commercials while drinking our morning coffee. You see it
          at the fast food place where we grab our breakfast that will sit in
          our stomachs like a brick for the rest of the day. Don’t forget about
          the almost daily phone call from someone trying to sell us on buying
          more time-shares for our family’s wellbeing. It is said so often that
          it has become an experience that we don’t often pay attention to
          unless it’s really terrible or exceptional. This does not in any way
          diminish the importance of Customer Service. When someone actually
          performs excellent Customer Service, it’s almost like you’ve just met
          a unicorn. Well as a Top Rated Mortgage Lender, I do provide excellent
          Customer Service and I would love to be given the opportunity to prove
          it.

          **"Out of all the people involved in our purchase of

          our new home, I think Vickie was the easily the most knowledgeable
          person that

          we dealt with. She pulled out all the stops to help us get into our
          new home

          and I would gladly recommend her to anyone looking for a lender and
          she is

          actually worth 10 stars, not just 5."**
